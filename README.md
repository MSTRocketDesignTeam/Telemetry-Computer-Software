# RDT Ground Station Software
#### This software will run on a ground station to display desired data of a high powered rocket made by MST's Rocket Design Team. To run this software, download all the files in the repo and run the RDT_GroundStation1.1.exe file. When the software makes a significant improvement, the .exe file will be updated. Opening the program can take about 20 seconds. 

#### Satellite tracking hotkeys:
 - A = Arm/Disarm tracker
 - H = Change HUD
 - ESC = Close program (Hitting x will not work)

#### Updates:
 - Satellite view is almost completed

#### Current tasks:
 - Working to incorporate satellite view into a larger GUI interface
